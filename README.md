> Ever ask your friends or family what to watch for the evening? This application can help with just that! This application allows you to search for tons of different movies. You can add a movie to a watchlist and in the watchlist you can like or dislike a movie once you have watched it. (Watching Feature Coming Soon!) You can also remove a movie from your watchlist if you did not mean to add it or if you are no longer interested in it. Please check out the live site and add a movie to the watchlist!
